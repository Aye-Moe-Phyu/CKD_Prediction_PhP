		<h2>Make healthy food choices</h2>
		<p>
			Choose foods that are healthy for your heart and your entire body: fresh fruits, fresh or frozen vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free 
			dairy products. Eat healthy meals, and cut back on salt and added sugars. Aim for less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium each day. Try to have less than 
			10 percent of your daily calories come from added sugars.

		</p>
		<h2>Make physical activity part of your routine</h2>
		<p>
			Be active for 30 minutes or more on most days. If you are not active now, ask your health care provider about the types and amounts of physical activity
			that are right for you. Add more activity to your life with these tips to help you get active.
		</p>
		<h2>Get enough sleep</h2>

			Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. If you have trouble sleeping, take steps to improve your sleep habits .
		</p>
		<h2>Stop smoking</h2>
		<p>
			If you smoke or use other tobacco products, stop. Ask for help so you donâ€™t have to do it alone. You can start by 
			calling the national quitline at 1-800-QUITNOW or 1-800-784-8669.

					<h2> Shortness of breath â€“ after very little effort</h2>
					<p>
						Why this happens:
						<br>
						Being short of breath can be related to the kidneys in two ways. First, extra fluid in the body can build up in the lungs.
						And second, anemia (a shortage of oxygen-carrying red blood cells) can leave your body oxygen-starved and short of breath.

					</p>
					<h2> Feeling faint, dizzy, or weak</h2>
					<p>
						Why this happens:
						<br>
						Anemia related to kidney failure means that your brain is not getting enough oxygen. This can lead to feeling faint, dizzy, or weak.

					<h2> Feeling very itchy</h2>
					<p>
						Why this happens:
						<br>
						Kidneys remove wastes from the bloodstream. When the kidneys fail, the build-up of wastes in your blood can cause severe itching.

					</p>
					<h2> Swelling in hands or feet</h2>
					<p>
						Why this happens:
						<br>
						Failing kidneys don't remove extra fluid, which builds up in your body causing swelling in the legs, ankles, feet, and/or hands.

					</p>

					<h2> Swollen or puffy face</h2>
					<p>
						Why this happens:
						<br>
						Failing kidneys don't remove extra fluid, which builds up in your body causing swelling in the face.
					</p>
					<h2> Getting up during the night to make urine</h2>
					<p>
						 Why this happens:
						<br>
						Kidneys make urine, so when the kidneys are failing, the urine may change. How?
							You may urinate more often, or in greater amounts than usual, with pale urine.
							You may feel pressure or have difficulty urinating.

					<h2> Foamy or bubbly urine</h2>
					<p>
						Why this happens:
						<br>
						Kidneys make urine, so when the kidneys are failing, the urine may change. How?
						Urine may be foamy or bubbly.
						This can lead to an above-normal amount of protein in the urine.

					</p>
					<h2> Brown, red, or purple urine</h2>
					<p>
						Why this happens:
						<br>
						Kidneys make urine, so when the kidneys are failing, the urine may change. How?
						You may urinate less often, or in smaller amounts than usual, with dark-colored urine.
						Your urine may contain blood.

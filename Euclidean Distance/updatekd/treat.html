		<h2>High blood pressure medications</h2>
		<p align="justify">
			 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People with kidney disease may experience worsening high blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend
			  medications to lower your blood pressure -commonly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers â€” and to preserve kidney function.
			High blood pressure medications can initially decrease kidney function and change electrolyte levels, so you may need 
			frequent blood tests to monitor.
		</p></td></tr></table>
		<h2>Medications to lower cholesterol levels</h2>
		<p align="justify">
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your doctor may recommend medications called statins to lower your cholesterol. People with chronic kidney disease often experience high levels of 
			 bad cholesterol,which can increase the risk of heart disease.
		</p>
		<h2>Medications to treat anemia</h2>
		<p align="justify">
			 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In certain situations, your doctor may recommend supplements of the hormone erythropoietin (uh-rith-roe-POI-uh-tin), sometimes with added iron. 
			 Erythropoietin supplements aid in production of more red blood cells, which may relieve fatigue and weakness associated with anemia.
		</p>
			 <h2>Medications to relieve swelling</h2>
		<p align="justify">
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People with chronic kidney disease may retain fluids. This can lead to swelling in the legs, as well as high blood pressure.
			 Medications called diuretics can help maintain the balance of fluids in your body.
		</p>
		<h2>Medications to protect your bones</h2>
		<p align="justify">
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements to prevent weak bones and lower your risk of fracture. You may also take
			medication known as a phosphate binder to lower the amount of phosphate in your blood, and protect your blood vessels from damage by 
			calcium deposits (calcification).
		</p>
		<h2>A lower protein diet to minimize waste products in your blood</h2>
		<p align="justify">
			  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As your body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that your kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount
			  of work your kidneys must do, your doctor may recommend eating less protein. Your doctor may also ask you to meet with a dietitian who can suggest 
			  ways to lower your protein intake while still eating a healthy diet.
